This repository contains all codes for the COMS 4995: Neural Network & Deep Learning final Spring'25 project at Columbia University.

## Usage

When running it the recommendation is using Google Colab with GPU available. You may create a work space and upload configuration files to the directory, or equivalently mount your drive and upload files to that.

Running the code space is essentially runing `main.ipynb` step by step which will guide you through the process of model fine-tuning and producing all evaluation results.
